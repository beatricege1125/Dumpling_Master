## **_About the Project_**

Dumpling Master is a restaurant simulation game where the user takes on the role of an owner and chef in a Chinese dumpling restaurant. The user must cook orders and manage resources to make their restaurant thrive. 


## **_Description_**

The game begins by presenting an optional storyline and tutorial. Once completed or skipped, the user can choose to start a new game or load a previous game.  From then on, the game can be split into two major phases; the day phase and the preparation phase. 


### **Day Phase**

During the day phase, the user receives orders and cooks dumplings according to those orders. The amount of money the user earns for each order varies by the cooking method and ingredients used in the dumplings. The cooking process takes on a memory-based game style, as the user must memorize the order and add the correct ingredients to the dumplings. Depending on the user’s accuracy, tips or refunds will be given. A review of the earnings and any mistakes the user made is displayed after completing each order. Evidently, the goal is to make a profit by cooking the dumplings correctly. 

The user must cook three orders each day, and upon completion, the user will move on to the preparation phase. A comprehensive review of the user’s earnings for the day will be shown at the end of each day. If the user’s current balance is negative at the end of the day, they are bankrupt and the game is over.


### **Preparation Phase**

In Dumpling Master, the user does not get an unlimited supply of free ingredients. The user must be mindful of the amount of each ingredient they have and remember to stock up on ingredients when supplies are low. This is done during the preparation phase. The user can also unlock new ingredients, adding variety to their dumplings. 

It should be noted that the user cannot stock or unlock ingredients during the day phase. Similarly, the user cannot receive orders and cook dumplings during the preparation phase. After the user finishes preparing, they can choose to begin the next day, and the cycle continues. 


### **Additional Gameplay Information**

In between the day phase and preparation phase, there is a short, optional phase where the user has the chance to earn extra money by participating in a small gamble. In Chinese culture, coins are often randomly hidden in the fillings of dumplings. Connecting to this cultural tradition, the user can spend $10 and choose a dumpling from nine dumplings. The user may or may not earn money based on the dumpling they choose.

Finally, in terms of exiting the game, the user can choose to exit in both the day and preparation phases. Their progress will be saved upon exiting the game.
